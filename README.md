# Multiclass Logistic Regression

In this notebook, we delve into the realm of multiclass logistic regression. Unlike binary logistic regression, which classifies between two classes, multiclass logistic regression extends the capability to handle multiple classes.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Model Training**: Implementing logistic regression for multiple classes using a one-vs-all (one-vs-rest) approach.
2. **Accuracy Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy of the trained model on a validation dataset.
3. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Visualizing the performance of the model through a confusion matrix, which provides insights into correct and incorrect classifications.
